The art of storytelling

Course details
1h 34m, Intermediate, Released: 12/4/2020

We are wired for story. We crave it. Storytelling has played an integral role in our ability to make progress as a species. It should come as no surprise, then, that presenting data and information in story form maximizes the effectiveness of our communication. We can create deeper emotional responses in our audience when we present data in story form.

Join data visualization expert Bill Shander as he guides you through the process of turning "facts and figures" into "story" to engage and fulfill our human expectation for information. This course is intended for anyone who works with data and has to communicate it to others, whether a researcher, a data analyst, a consultant, a marketer, or a journalist. Bill shows you how to think about, and craft, stories from data by examining many compelling stories in detail.

* Introduction

- The art of storytelling
+ Four Components of Story
1. Plot: how the story unfolds
2. Portagonist: the main character
3. Problem: a difficult goal for the protogonist to achieve
4. Transformation - the "so what": how the protagonist changes as a result

* 1. Why Storytelling

- Humans are wired for story
+ *Useful Fictions: Evolution, Anxiety, and the Origins of Literature (Frontiers of Narrative)* - Michael Austin
+ Storytelling
> Fictional stories produce and neutralize anxiety
> Our survival depends on it
+ Successful Narrative
> Anxiety increases as time increases [then peaks and decreases? not shown]
+ *Wired for Story: The Writer's Guild to Using Brain Science to Hook Readers from the Very First Sentence* - Lisa Cron
> "...crucial to our evolution - more so than opposable thumbs. Opposable thumbs let us hang on; story told us what to hang on to."
+ Storytelling
> Fictional
> Data (Journalistic)
+ "Narrative Style Influences Citation Frequency in Climate Change Science" - Hiller, Kelly, Klinger (PLOS ONE online)
+ Takeaways
> Stories are a survival mechanism
> Think like a storyteller
> Data requires context

- Data storytelling is essential, except when it isn't
+ Your primary job as a human is to be a communicator
+ Did It Happen?
> If a tree falls in a forest...
> Pics or it didn't happen
+ "Helping Business Students Acquire the Skills Needed for a Career in Analytics: A Comprehensive Industry Assessment of Entry-Level Requirements" - Stratton and Stratton(Decision Sciences online)
+ There's more to communication than numbers on paper
+ Stories are up to 22 times more memorable than facts alone (reseach summary)
+ Stats vs. Story
> 21% of children under the age of 18 live in poverty (stat)
> 21% of kids live below the poverty line (story) [1 in 5 of kids in school]
+ Words like chair (object) & coffee (sense memory) affect brain differently
+ Tips
> Use Visuals
> Write engaging copy
> Include sensory inputs
+ "Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data" - Segel & Heer (Stanford Vis Group online)
> "A purely author-driven approach has a strict linear path through the visualization, relies heavily on messaging, and includes no interactivity."
> "A purely reader-driven approach has no prescribed ordering of images, no messaging, and a high degree of interactivity"
+ Gallery / Viz of the Day Tableau webpage -> Dasboards
+ When in doubt, tell stories
+ Stanford paper:
> "Data stories appear to be most effective when they have constrained interaction at various checkpoints within a narrative, allowing the user to explore the data without veering too far from the intended narrative."

+ Story Structure
> bell-shaped curve: beginning (low point), middle (peak), end (low point)
+ Headline
