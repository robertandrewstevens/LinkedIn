Every software developer wants to ship high-quality applications.
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a key discipline that can help you
enhance your development process—and, in turn, your code base—by
ensuring that crashes and bugs are addressed early on. In this course,
join Richard Wells as he covers unit testing and TDD for Python
projects. Richard provides an overview of both unit testing and TDD,
explaining why both are crucial for developers. He also shows how to set
up your development environment for TDD and goes over the `pytest`
unit-testing framework. Throughout the course, he shares best practices
and provides examples and test cases that can help you gain a practical
understanding of TTD in Python.
