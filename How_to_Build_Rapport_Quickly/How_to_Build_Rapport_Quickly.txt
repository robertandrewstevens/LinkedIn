With the rise of technology, people are having fewer face-to-face conversations. As a result, there are fewer opportunities to practice and build our social skills. But with numerous studies showing that having fewer social relationships negatively affects our health, relationship building isn't a skill we can afford to lose. In this course, adapted from the podcast "How to Be Awesome at Your Job", best-selling author and customer service consultant John DiJulius shares expert tips for quickly building lasting emotional ties. John outlines the five essential characteristics of relationship building, emphasizing the role that authenticity, curiosity, and empathy play in forging genuine connections. He shares topics you can turn to quickly build rapport and find common ground. Plus, he goes over how to take cues from investigative reporters to ask questions that spark a lively discussion.

* The ability to connect sets you apart

* The five pillars of building rapport
1. Must be authentic
2. Must be insatiable curiosity
3. Must have incredible empathy
4. Must love people [only 1 that cannot be taught]
5. Must be a great listener

* Ask questions in four important areas
- TED Talk: "Meet as Strangers Leave as Friends"
- Everyone wants:
+ "Make me feel important"
+ Gift of attention
- Focus on other person's FORD
1. F = Family (married? kids?)
2. O = Occupation (job)
3. R = Recreation (free time)
4. D = Dreams (bucket list)

* Avoid stealing the spotlight
- Listen, but don't ask too many questions (4 to 1) or be a sponge - be a trampoline (ask clarifying questions and heighten the energy)
- Don't ask a question that you are dying to answer yourself
- Don't finish the other person's sentence
- Don't steal someone's thunder (do not "one up" - let them brag)

* Get curious by thinking like a reporter
- Ask "why?"

* Steer conversations to positive memories
- "why?" -> story (when, how, who, where)
- Find their hot button
- Follow up (e.g. Google it) and follow-up
