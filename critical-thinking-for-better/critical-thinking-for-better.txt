# Critical Thinking for Better Judement and Decision-Making

## Course details

56m * Advanced * Updated: 7/16/2020

The pace of change and volume of information we encounter in daily life make it hard to think through decisions. Instead, people often rely on biases and rules of thumb, which trap them into drawing faulty conclusions. The most successful teams use critical thinking—objective and rational analysis—to illuminate the wisest conclusions. This course prepares leaders to hone the critical thinking skills of their entire organization. Learn how to upgrade critical thinking to avoid deceiving fallacies, spot misleading cognitive biases, craft better arguments, hone judgment, and improve decision-making. Instructor Becki Saltzman teaches skills that will improve how your company or team innovates, tackles challenges, and responds to change.

## 2. Minimizing Bad Judgment

### A Nobel Prize-winning way to think about thinking

[Daniel Kahneman background]

#### System 1 vs. System 2

- System 1
    + Fast
	+ Automatic
	+ Efficient
	+ Unconscious

- System 2
    + Slow
	+ Effortful
	+ Controlled 

[Key is to match the type to the situation, where most often people apply System 1 when they should apply System 2]

[All DS projects require System 2?]

#### System 2 Thinking

1. Stop multitasking

2. Turn off notifications 

3. Sleep (get enough)

4. Eat (don't judge on an empty stomach)

5. Avoid complex situations (requires self-control and pre-work, e.g. pre-reading)

[error: thinking fast when you should be thinking slow]

### Can you spot these cognitive biases?

#### Notice **blind spot bias** in yourself

[easy to spot biases in others; hard to spot biases in yourself (Richard Feyman - fool yourself quote?)]

#### Confirmation Bias

- Objective Facts (Circle)

- Facts Confriming Your Beliefs (Circle)

- What You Believe (Intersection)

#### Affect heuristic

- [Rely on emomtional feelings]
    + [e.g., like Telsa cars, so think Telsa company is a good investment]

#### False consensus bias 

- [overestimate how much others agree with us, and think differing opinions are wrong]

#### Clustering Illusion

- Seeing patterns where there aren't any
    + [And confuse correlation and causation]

#### Availability Heuristic

- Everything happening in the world (Big circle)

- Information covered by the news (Small circle inside big circle)

- [Overestimate likelihood of events that come easily to mind (due to news reports)]

#### [In Class Exercise]

1. "I like their product. We should invest in them."
    + Affect heuristic

2. "We looked for an found plenty of evidence that the tool we created is the most effective."
    + Confirmation Bias

3. "I just read a report about people being run over in parking lots... The likelihood of people being run over in parking lots has gone up."
    + Availability Heuristic

Fast thinking allows you to evaluate a decision.

Fast thinking enables you to withstand long meetings.

Fast thinking is prone to misleading biases and judgment errors. - Yes
    + Thinking too fast causes you to not see all of the facts, and thus leads to biases and judgment errors.

Fast thinking is effortful.

2. Rasherz has done 10 analysis reports this month. His boss thinks Rasherz is on a streak. Which type of bias is Rasherz's boss displaying?

clustering illusion - Yes 
    + This scenario describes the bias that occurs when there is a pattern with a misleading correlation.

consensus bias

confirmation bias

availability heuristic

3. Which statement reflects confirmation bias?

She doesn't support the proposal.

Everyone we asked agreed with us. - Yes 
    + Finding only confirming evidence may be a hint that you're only looking for it.

Nobody wants to hear from him.

Let's check the safety of that assumption. - Yes 

## 3. Improving Decision Quality

### The REF method: Your intuition referee

#### Intuition

- Thinking you know something without relying on conscious reasoning 

#### Three Conditions for Trusting Intuition: REF

- Regularity

- Exposure

- Feedback

#### Regularity

[verbal comments/examples]

#### Exposure

[verbal comments/examples]

#### Feedback

- Timeline: Intuition ------ Feedback
    + [Must have a short timeline between Intution and Feedback]

#### [What's not 1 of the 3 Conditions?]

- Regularity

- Exposure

- Feedback

- Confidence - X

### Using conterfactual thinking

#### Conterfactual Thinking

- Uncovering possible alternatives to outcomes from past events 

- Upward counterfactuals are better alternative outcomes

- Downward counterfactuals are worse alternative outcomes 

#### 5 Steps

1. Identify a prior event with an unexpect outcome 

2. Find factors leading to the outcome 

3. Select a factor to modify

4. Assess consequences of modification

5. Generate a counterfactual 

#### [Example: Negotiating terms of payments]

[Under control...]

- First meeting

- Asked to go to net-90 days 

- Stressed supplier's value 

[Did not control...]

- Contract with another company

- New tariffs 

### Overcoming dangers of loss aversion 

#### Choose a Scenario 1

- Option A: +$900, 100% chance?
    + Most pick this - "sure deal"

- Option B: $1,000, 90% chance? 

#### Choose a Scenario 2

- Option A: -$900, 100% chance?

- Option B: -$1,000, 90% chance? 
    + Most pick this - not a "sure deal"

[pain of loss > pleasure of win]

#### [Because of loss aversion...]

- Failed projects are considered twice as bad as successful project are considered good 

### [How to fix...]

[Separate Quality of Decision Process and Quality of Outcome]

- Exercise Files > Decision Process Score Card.pdf

#### Score Card 

1. Did we use our preexisting decision framework?

2. Did we gather relevant information?

3. Did we gather irrelevant information?

4. Did we list assumptions to challenge? 

5. Did we make sure our sources are credible? 

6. Did we eliminate biases?

7. Did we include the right people?

8. Did we indentify at least two alternatives?

9. Did we weigh evidence supporting the decision? 

10. Did we weigh evidence rejecting the decision?

11. Did we choose between alternatives? 

#### Decision Process (DP) Scoring

Points Score    Action
------ -------- --------------------
11-10  Great DP Consider the outcome
9- 7   Good DP  Almost there 
4-6    OK DP    Add to your DP
0-3    Poor DP  Improve your DP

### Chapter Quiz

1. Which statement does NOT reflect loss aversion?

I will not sell my house for less than what I paid for it.

Let's not renegotiate because we may end up with a worse contract.

You win a few, you lose a few. - Yes
    + Loss aversion suggests people move to avoid a loss more than to achieve a gain.

Those who might lose will fight harder than those who might gain.

2. Which type of counterfactual refers to an improved outcome?

incline counterfactual

upward counterfactual - Yes 

decline counterfactual

downward counterfactual

3. Which technique is recommended for a loss aversion situation?

Analyze the quality of relevant information with the quality of irrelevant information.

Analyze the quality of a decision process separate from the quality of the people.

Analyze the quality of a decision process separate from the quality of the outcome. - Yes 
    + One method of achieving this is to use a decision process scorecard that focuses on the decision process and outcome.

Analyze the quality of the outcome with the quality of the alternatives.

4. What are the three conditions necessary to trust intuition?

regularity, exposure, feedback  - Yes 

exposure, confidence, feedback

reality, expertise, frequency

confidence, regularity, expertise

5. Which condition would you least rely on when deciding whether to use your intuition?

regularity

exposure

feedback

confidence - Yes 
    + This is not a condition you would use to test whether your intuition is reliable.

6. Indra is using counterfactual thinking to discover alternatives for a past unexpected outcome. What is the next step she should take?

Assess consequences of each modification.

Generate a counterfactual.

## 4. Critical Thinking Fallacies 

### Most common logical fallacies at work 

#### Logical Fallacies 

- Flaws in reasoning 

#### Identifying Logical Fallacies: Benefits 

- Separate fact from fiction 

- Make better arguments 

- Set aside illogical arguments 

#### Post Hoc, Erog Propter Hoc 

- Latin for "after this, therefore because of this"

- Claiming a former event caused a latter event 

#### Example

- "Did you see our sales dropped in February?"

- "Yes, because Martin joined the company in February!"

[confusing correlation with causation]

#### Ad Hominem

- Ingorning the logic of an argument and instead attacking the person making it 

#### Example

- Person 1: "The numbers for the proposed IT system don't add up."

- Person 2: "But, Marcus, you don't have an MBA!"

#### Straw Man 

- Substiuting argument with a misrepresented view of it 

#### Example

- Person 1: "Let's only hire candidates with five years of experience or less."

- Person 2: "Monique, should we just eliminate all qualifications?"
    + [Distorted view of Person 1's opinion] 

- Person 2: "We're not going to use Monique's non-qualifications-necessary standard!"
    + [Attacks Person 1]

[Sneaky argument subsitution]

#### Hasty Generalization

- Drawing conclusions from limited evidence 

#### Example 

- Small sample X (3 dots) is taken from population P (10 x 18 = 180 dots)
    + Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and Opra Winfrey were college drop-outs

- Conclusion Z is drawn from sample X and applied to population P 
    + Dropping out of college will not negatively impact your career 

### Avoiding the planning fallacy

[Taylor Swift: just because you made a plan, doesn't mean that's gonna happen]

#### Planning Fallacy 

- [6 calendars = 6 month plan?]

1. Being overly optimistic 

2. Failing to consider data 

#### [Use The Outside View]

- Inside View
    + Gathering information
	+ Determining length of contributions 
	+ Adding intelligence
	+ Projecting out 

- Outside View 
    + Finding references
	+ Using data 
	+ Adjusting projections z
	
[When others were in this situation, what happened?]

#### Applying the Outside View

- Reference class 
    + [similar projects or problems]

- Statstics [on reference class]

- Predictions or adjustments 

#### Pro Tip 

- The Green Book
    + GOV.UK
	+ Project data 
	
### Using framing to your advantage

#### [Eyewitness study example]

- [Framing question changed answers]

- How fast were cars moving when they:
    + "contacted each other"
    + "hit each other"
	+ "smashed each other" => fastest speed estimate

#### Using Framing to Your Advantage 

1. Choose a negative or positive frame 
    + [use "win" vs. "lose" in question or statement]

2. Take either a loss or gain approach 

3. Match emotions 

#### Positive vs. Negative Framing 

- Positive
    + Why Acme should win 

- Negative:
    + Why Titan should lose 

[select depending on your goal]

#### [Loss vs. Gain Example]

- Coin toss gamble
    + Tails -$100
    + Heads +$150
	+ [Most would reject offer because losing $100 psychologically hurts more, but not a rational decision]

#### When to use Gain or Loss Frame

- Gain-framed arguments work when outcome is **clear**
    + [get favored supplier status if ship on time] 
	+ [you will live longer if you stop texting while driving]

- Loss-framed arguments work when outcome is **uncertain**
    + [if you don't ship on time, you won't get favored supplier status]
	+ [you will die sooner if you don't stop texting while driving]

#### Match emotions example

- How fast were cars moving when they:
    + "contacted each other" - low emotion
    + "hit each other" - moderate emotion
	+ "smashed each other" - high emotion 

[pick emotion to fit desired outcome]

[be on the lookout for others using this framing approach to influence your decisions and judgments]

### Chapter Quiz

1. Which is a key benefit of spotting and avoiding fallacies?

knowing who to support

having more influence

Use your intuition.

Use the inside view.

4. Armina has a message to give to her department in which the outcome is uncertain. How should she frame her argument?

Armina should use a gain frame.

Armina should use a positive frame.

Armina should use a loss frame. - Yes
    + This is the best choice, since a loss frame is more persuasive than a gain frame when the outcome is unknown.

Armina should use an emotional frame.

5. You are listening to coworkers and notice an ad hominem fallacy in their conversation. What do you need to caution against with this fallacy?

dismissing valid evidence from people with whom you do not agree - Yes 
    + An ad hominem fallacy occurs when you are ignoring logic or valid content because you are attacking the person making the argument.

confusing correlation with causation

relying too much on your own experiences and jumping to conclusions

substituting sneaky arguments

6. Which statement is false?

Acme should win is a positive frame. "Widget should lose" is a negative frame.

Frames can't make you think you see things that you don't actually see. - Yes 

If the outcome is uncertain, loss-frames are more persuasive than gain-frames.

How information is presented influences your judgment and decisions in ways that can defy reason.
