#### AutoML tools: Why use them?

- Automate the repetitive steps of machine learning

- Automatic feature engineering

- Experiment faster: The more things you try, the more you know!

- Hyperparameter tuning for models out of the box

- Develop multiple baselines to improve upon

### Chapter Quiz

1. Which of these steps come first in a machine learning process?
- featurization
- hyperparameter search
- collecting and preparing data - Yes
    + The first step is usually collecting data that is related to the problem to be solved and preparing it for use by data scientists.
- model evaluation

2. Which model do you begin with when you start model training?
- a supervised learning model
- a simple model - Yes
    + It is always best to start with a baseline model you can use to benchmark performance on the problem
- an unsupervised learning model
- a complex model

3. Which of these steps cannot be handled by AutoML?
- model selection
- hyperparameter search
- data collection - Yes
    + "AutoML" can perform feature selection, hyperparameter search and model selection
    + However, data scientists still need to curate data related to the problem they want to solve
- feature selection

## 2. AutoML for Tabular Data

### Introducing AutoGluon

- Exercise Files > 02-automl-for-tabular-data > 02_01b.ipynb

### Training your first AutoGluon model

- Exercise Files > 02-automl-for-tabular-data > 02_02b.ipynb

### Improving your AutoGluon model

- Exercise Files > 02-automl-for-tabular-data > 02_03b.ipynb

### Challenge: Flight delay prediction

- Exercise Files > 02-automl-for-tabular-data > 02_04.ipynb

### Solution: Flight delay prediction 

- Exercise Files > 02-automl-for-tabular-data > 02_05.ipynb

### Chapter Quiz

1. AutoGluon can only handle tabular data.
- TRUE
- FALSE - Yes
    + `AutoGluon` can also be used for text and image data

2. Which of the methods returns a dataframe containing metrics for all the models trained by the TabularPredictor?
- fit_summary
- extra_info
- leaderboard - Yes
    + "TabularPredictor.leaderboard()" returns a dataframe containing metrics and other information about all the trained models
- predict_proba

3. What does the `refit_full` parameter do in the line of code below?

```
predictor = predictor.fit(train, presets=['best_quality'], refit_full='all')
```

- Trains only interpretable rule-based models
- Trains models with the best predictive accuracy possible
- Retrain model on all of the data (training + validation) - Yes
    + s parameter ensures that the model is retrained after validation on the full data (training + validation)
- Delete unused models and training artifacts

## 3. AutoML for Image Data

### Computer vision: How do you handle image data?

#### AutoML for Image Data

#### Difference from Tabular Data

- Image data is unstructured

- Each image may have multiple channels (RGB)

- Using tools like NumPy, we can read image data as 3D arrays for processing

- For problems involving image data, deep learning models are often used

#### Computer Vision

Computer Vision is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to derive information from digital images and other visual inputs [What is computer vision? - IBM]

- Image classification: classifying dogs versus cats

- Facial recognition: unlocking smart devices

- Object detection: detecting banned items in passenger baggage

- Image segmenation: scene understanding and aerial image processing

#### Tools

- Image processsing tools: OpenCV and scikit-image

- Labeling tools: Labelbox and Supervisely

- Deep learning frameworks: PyTorch, TensorFlow, and YOLO

- Ready-made solutions: Azure Custom Vision, Amazon Rekognition, and IBM Watson Visual Recognition
