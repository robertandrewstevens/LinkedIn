# Generative AI: Working with Large Language Models

## Course details

1h 8m * Advanced * Released: 9/30/2022

Transformers have quickly become the go-to architecture for natural language processing (NLP). As a result, knowing how to use them is now a business-critical skill in your AI toolbox. In this course, instructor Jonathan Fernandes walks you through many of the key large language models (LLMs) developed since OpenAI first released GPT-3, as well as the key contributions of each of these LLMs.

## Learning objectives

- Identify the release dates of large language models

- Interpret actions needed to successfully run large language models

- Differentiate several types of large language models

- Assess the capabilities of several large language models

- Discover key contributions of large language models

- Determine the role that scaling laws have in each large language model
