# Critical Thinking

## Course details

59m * General * Updated: 10/6/2020

Critical thinking is the ability to think reflectively and independently in order to make thoughtful decisions. By focusing on root-cause issues critical thinking helps you avoid future problems that can result from your actions. In this course, leadership trainer and expert Mike Figliuolo outlines a series of techniques to help you develop your critical thinking skills. He reveals how to define the problem you're trying to solve and then provides a number of critical thinking tools such as blowing up the business, asking the 5 whys and the 7 so whats, exploring the 80/20 rule, and more. He also provides guidance on how to develop this skill across your whole team.

## 1. What is Critical Thinking?

### The importance of critical thinking

#### Multiple Stakeholders graphic

#### Bottlenecks x Problems / Limited time

### Distinguish causes vs. consequences

#### Evaluate the cause 

#### Consider the consequences 

#### Causes of Incomplete Website

- Code not ready 
    + Symptom

- Specs not done ^^^
    + Symptom

- Disagreement on features ^^^
    + Symptom

- No clarify from leadership ^^^
    + Root-cause

#### Consquences of Closed Network 

- New customers must call vvv

- Staff is overworked vvv

- Customer service suffers vvv

- Loss of customers 

### Problem Timeline

- Causes
    + Think backward about the causes
	+ Symptoms => Root-cause

- Problem ^^^ / vvvv

- Consquences
    + Think foreward about the consequences
	+ New problems?

### Break big problems into small ones

#### Profit Problem

```
Profit Problem [CTQ flowdown]
    Revenue drop
	    Low volume
		    Current customers
			Prospective customers
		Low prices
    Cost increase [from suppliers]
	    High prices
		    Base price increase
			Discount drop
		More purchases [buying more stuff]
```

[start on a whiteboard]

### Ask yourself

- What is your big problem composed of?

- What smaller issues drive it?

### Chapter Quiz

1. During the critical thinking process what's the first thing you should consider?
- schedule
- consequences
- causes - Yes
    + If you don't understand the cause of the problem, it's virtually impossible to solve it
- stakeholder goals

2. You start on a new project that seems very similar to previous work you've done. You immediately dive in and proceed as you have done before. Why is your bold start probably a mistake?
- You should first build a budget
- You should first build a team
- You should wait for a go-ahead from your supervisors
- You should take time to think critically about the scope of the project - Yes 
    + Issues such as identifying stakeholders, information sources, bottlenecks, and lag times should be clarified

3. When do you know that you have broken down a problem sufficiently?
- when it is impossible to break down the problem further - Yes => No
    + At this stage, you may have dissected the problem too extensively
- when solutions begin to become obvious - Yes 
    + When a problem becomes small, it often becomes simple
- when the problem divisions become symmetric
- when the problem parts match the number of team members

4. What's the recommended strategy for dealing with a complex problem that has no obvious solution?
- Assign parts of the problem to each person on your team
- List out the consequences, then analyze the cause for each one
- Throw in the towel and go out for a double latte
- Break the problem down into smaller, more solvable pieces - Yes 
    + Big problems are much easier to solve in smaller pieces rather than tackling the whole problem at once

5. Your team has completed writing recommendations for solving a major problem in your business unit. How can you make implementation go smoothly?
- by anticipating unintended consequences - Yes 
    + The recommendations may cause more problems than they solve
- by consulting with senior management
- by implementing the plans as quickly as possible
- by making implementation optional

6. Why do people tend to rush off and start solving the problem without understanding causes and consequences first?
- It allows them to reverse engineer the causes
- It makes them feel like they're being responsive to stakeholders - Yes 
    + While it's great to want to be responsive to stakeholders, they're more interested in seeing you solve the true root causes, rather than just getting busy with problem solving
- They know that causes and consequences get figured out at the end
- They can avoid getting get tasked with solving additional problems
