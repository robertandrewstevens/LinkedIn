The ability to lead virtually is more important than ever. The global economy means many organizations are collaborating with clients and colleagues across the world — and the COVID-19 pandemic has forced many on-site teams to transition to work-from-home positions. In these challenging times, leaders have to maintain a careful balancing act — balancing vulnerability and presence, authority and empathy — to truly connect with remote employees and keep their businesses moving in the right direction. This course collects timely, relevant advice for leading virtual teams and projects. Authors Simon Sinek and Charlene Li — and comedian Lisa Lampanelli — offer guidance on building trust, listening, practicing servant leadership, and engaging stakeholders inside and outside the organization.
