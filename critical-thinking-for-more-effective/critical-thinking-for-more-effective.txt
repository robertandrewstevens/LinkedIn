In order to be a successful leader, clear communication is a key aspect to your effectiveness. After a conversation with you, do people feel clear on your position, or confused? Are they confident that you’ll welcome different perspectives, or are they uncomfortable voicing disagreement with you? In this course, Becki Saltzman shows how critical thinking improves your clarity of thought and conversation confidence, and explains how and when to communicate using critical thinking. Becki gives advice on how to construct good arguments and recognize bad ones, how to maintain productive communication even when you disagree, and how to recognize the difference between debating and negotiating. Whether you’re a seasoned leader or new to a leadership role, by the end of this course you’ll have new ways to communicate more effectively through critical thinking.

## 1. Becoming Argument Literate

### Communicating with logic

#### Experiments with logic vs. emotion

- Emotional and logical thinking are vital for effective communication 

#### Logical Communication 

- Constructing arguments with facts, reasonable truth claims, and clear language 

#### Example from client: acne treatments 

- Statement: Treatment A is better than treatment B
    + Truth? => Fact?
    + Fact?
    + Opinion? => Fact?

#### Facts 

- Exists regardless of whether it's perceived 

#### Truths 

- Claims based on our perceptions and reasoning 

#### Opinions 

- Matters of preference 

### Creating good arguments

#### Claims

- Claim A 
    + "It's best to provide a distributed work option."

- Claim B 
    + "It's best to keep all the employees together."

#### Creating Good Arguments 

1. Include the work "because" after a claim 

2. Use evidence to support reasons 

3. Avoid using anecdotes as evidence 

4. Cite a true authority
    +  [if using Appeal to Authority argement, which is a logical fallacy]

#### Claims (revised)

- Claim A 
    + "It's best to provide a distributed work option."
	+ "It is best to keep the existing space and offer distribued work option, because it gives employees more choices."

- Claim B 
    + "It's best to keep all the employees together."
	+ "It's best to keep all the employees together, because physical togetherness creates the sense of family that's part of the company's commitment to our employees."

### Exposing bad arguments

#### Example 

- "Hector doesn't understand entrepreneurship, because he's only ever worked in large companies."

#### Two lessons to keep in mind 

1. Exposing a bad argument is not the same as exposing a bad conclusion 

2. A good conclusion can follow a bad argument 

[separate idea from person making the argument: smart people can make bad arguements, and bad people can make good arguments]

#### Straw Man Fallacy 

1. Distort opponent's claim 

2. Argue against that distorted claim 

3. Win argument 

#### Hollow Man 

1. Invent a ridiculous position (no one is arguing)

2. Attribute it to a vaguely defined opponent 

3. Argue against that argument (no one was making) 

4. Win argument 

#### Avoiding Fallacies within Bad Arguments 

1. Highlight common ground 

2. Restate opponent's claims clearly 

3. Identify learnings 
    + Don't call out the fallacy 

4. Ask opponent to summarize (your argument)
    + (and check they are fairly representing your argument)

### Crafting persuasive arguments

#### Example

- (Arguing politics, supporting reasearch, and small sample size; asked for more evidence, but opponent was stumped)

- "Would you be open to me sharing compelling reasons to support my claim and a compelling reason to support yours?"

- There's a difference between getting your opponent to say or act like they agree with you, and actually getting them to agree with you"

#### Crafting Persuasive Arguments 

1. Identify one thing you like about your opponent's argument 

2. Offer an argument in support of your opponent's position 

3. Acknowledge a weakness in your own argument before providing a strong reason in support 

### Chapter Quiz

1. What does "blemishing" mean?

using salicylic acid acne cream instead of benzoyl peroxide

stopping before jumping to conclusions

3. How do you construct a good argument?

    + Information questions show how we arrive at our beliefs

### Navigating critical thinking in groups

#### Challenger Accident (1986)

(cause: O-ring and testing temperature lower limit > actutal temperure)

- Groupthink (root-cause) 

(2 headlines and long URLs: astronaut/teacher and Reagan)

#### When making critical decisions

- Include an assumption buster to challenge consensus 
    + Natural skeptic 

- Encourage the assumption buster to challenge you, then swap roles 

- Collect opinions independently and anonymously 

- Watch out for group decision fatigue 

- Make it clear that you will prioritize reliable, relevant data 

### Dealing with deep disagreements 

#### Argument Optimist vs. Arugment Pessimist 

- Argument Optimist: there's common ground to be found in every disagreement 

- Arugment Pessimist: there's rarely any common ground to be found in people who disagree disagree, so walk away or defeat 

#### Example 

(argue because they are and are open to new arguements)

#### Dealing with Deep Disagreements 

1. Prepare your body language 

2. Separate the person from the position 

3. Avoid expressing outrage 

4. Beware of the false consensus bias 

5. Connect your arguments to the best of what your opponent is claiming 

#### False Consensus Bias 

Thinking that people agree for the same reasons, and disagree for the same reasons 

### Jumping to conclusions

#### Think about what you can ask 

- Example: (person with personal, family, and work stress)

- Making assumpitons not based on reliable evidence can lead you to communicate ineffectively or shut down communication 

- Share evidence to support a more accurate conclusion 

- Notice labeling, and lead with curiosity 

#### Start with curiosity

- "What might I be missing?"

### Chapter Quiz

1. When do you want to avoid deep disagreements?

when you know the other person is wrong - Yes -> NO 

when you're an argument optimist - Yes -> NO 

when the topic is too complex - Yes -> NO 

when you can't help thinking the other person is stupid or morally challenged - Yes 

2. What can you do to preserve critical thinking in groups?

Use independent contractors to provide more reliable data.

Make sure you have smart, like-minded people on teams where important decisions are being made.

Bring in an assumption buster and collect opinions independently and anonymously. - Yes 

Encourage people to speak up and share their opinions.

3. Why do you want to ask essential questions?

because you want to persuade others without being too obvious

because there are no dumb questions

because you're more committed to discovering the truth than proving yourself right - Yes 

because you want to avoid making people feel that they're wrong

4. How do you prevent others from jumping to conclusions about you?

Point out where people are wrong about you before they label you.

Recognize when people are just out to get you and learn to be okay with that. 

Don't let people interrupt you before you finish making your case.

Ask if you can provide evidence to support a more valid conclusion. - Yes
