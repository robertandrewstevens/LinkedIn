In this course, psychologist and author Dr. Gemma Leigh Roberts first guides you through both how to receive feedback effectively — by tuning into a growth mindset, managing your emotional response to feedback, and implementing feedback. Gemma then teaches you on how to effectively provide feedback by reducing bias, following a tested frame for giving feedback, and learning how to give feedback regularly. Join Gemma in this course and learn tips that will help lead you into a cycle of continuous development, and a growth mindset that can help propel your career and your relationships forward.
