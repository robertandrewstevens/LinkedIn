### How to write an effective prompt for AI

#### Topics and Quality 

- xy plot
    + x = Topic
	+ y = Quality
	
- Pick a specific topic and focus on the high quality region 

#### CREATE

- C: Character 
    + Tell AI the role you want it to play (persona)

- R: Request
    + Tell AI what we want it to do
	+ Be specific with context
    + More is better 	

- E: Examples (optional)
    + previous content, like a headline, or tone of voice

### How to work with the responses from a generative AI chatbot 

#### Advice

- Do not think of AI as a search engine 

- Search engine: 
    + search term -> Search Result

- AI is a journey:
    + chat prompt -> reponse
	+ (repeat n times)
	+ chat prompt -> Workable Output

- Treat AI as a collaborator rather than a servant 
    + Give and take 
	+ Give feedback
	+ If you get something you like, say so and ask AI to expand on that thinking 
	+ Share new ideas with AI and ask to explore that concept 

- Don't treat results as final
    + Add human touch to take from adequate to excellent

- Check accuracy of output 

- Be honest if you are using AI
